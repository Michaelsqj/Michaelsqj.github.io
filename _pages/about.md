ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Qijia, a Chinese student with infinite curiosity!

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the whole pipeline of medical imaging, including acquisition/reconstruction/post-processing/analysis.
 During my undergraduate study, I have been primarily focusing on medical image analysis, including `segmentation` of 2D/ 3D structures on 
`Optical Microscopic` & `Electronic Microscopic` images. 

ðŸŒ± Currently I'm learning the `acquisition` and `reconstruction` of `MRI`, to be more specific, `ASL` (Arterial Spin Labeling).

ðŸ“« I'm also looking forward to exploring various fields especially `robotics`, and hoping to work in the interdisciplinary field in the future.
