ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Qijia, a Chinese student with infinite curiosity!

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in medical imaging and computer vision, including acquisition/reconstruction/post-processing/analysis.
 During my undergraduate study, I have been primarily focusing on medical image analysis, including `segmentation` of 2D/ 3D structures on 
`Optical Microscopic` & `Electronic Microscopic` images. 

ðŸŒ± Currently I'm working on the `acquisition` and `reconstruction` of `MRI`, to be more specific, I've been working on optimizing sampling in the `k-space` of `MRI` and reconstruction using compressed sensing and machine learning.

ðŸ“« I've also been working on `3D-aware image synthesis` from 2D images in the wild apart from PhD study, and I'm honored to be guided by Dr. Guangrun Wang.

I'm also looking forward to exploring various fields, and hoping to work in the interdisciplinary field in the future.
