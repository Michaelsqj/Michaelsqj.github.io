**Sequence**: 4D implementation of Combined Angiography and Perfusion using **Radial Imaging and Arterial Spin Labeling** (**CAPRIA**) 

**Reconstruction**: whole-brain **dynamic** **angiogram**, time-resolved **perfusion** map from **same raw data set**

angiography: blood flow in large arteries to visualize stenoses, occlusions, abnormal vessels.

perfusion:
