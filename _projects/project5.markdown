4D combined angiographic, structural and perfusion radial imaging using arterial spin labelling (CASPRIA) provides a tool to simultaneously acquire information about brain structure and blood flow. However, the radial trajectory used limits the resolution and SNR, especially when the data is highly undersampled. In this work, an optimised 3D cone trajectory is presented with 3D golden means rotation to improve sampling at the k-space periphery whilst maintaining flexibility in spatiotemporal resolution. A locally low rank reconstruction was used to leverage spatiotemporal correlations and improve image quality. In vivo results showed considerable improvements in resolution and SNR over the radial approach.
