Carcinoma pharyngeal can easily be missed in the endoscope and sometimes can not be distinguished from inflammation. What we do here is to automatically diagnose based on the endoscopic images but also need to provide rough localization for doctors. To do this, we need to make use of limited labeled data with rough annotations.
