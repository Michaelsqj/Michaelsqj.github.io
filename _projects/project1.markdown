MitoEM dataset is currently the largest mitochondria dataset (4096x4096x1000). The dataset is anisotropic and the mitochondria can extend to 1M voxels with various morphology. We try to reduce the false split and false merge by introducing new representations and also by appropriate error correction.

I contributed to the open source project [Github Repo](https://github.com/Michaelsqj/pytorch_connectomics) from VCG Lab at Harvard University during my summer internship.
