      <h3>3D Connectomics Segmentation</h3>
      <p><b>MitoEM dataset is currently the largest mitochondria dataset (4096x4096x1000). The dataset is anisotropic and the mitochondria can extend to 1M voxels with various morphology. We try to reduce the false split and false merge by introducing new representations and also by appropriate error correction.</b></p>

      <h3>Multi-organ Nuclei Segmentation & Classification</h3>
      <p><b>Pathological image reading is time consuming. And we try to develop a method that can simultaneously segment and classify nuclei on the pathologicla image. Also due to the H&E staining, the color of each image varies which we found can significantly impact the classification performance. In addition, we come up with a U-Net based model with less parameters. </b></p>

      <h3>Carcinoma Pharyngeal Localization in Endoscope</h3>
      <p><b>Carcinoma pharyngeal can easily be missed in the endoscope and sometimes can not be distinguished from inflammation. What we do here is to automatically diagnose based on the endoscopic images but also need to provide rough localization for doctors. To do this, we need to make use of limited labeled data with rough annotations.</b></p>
